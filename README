NAME
    cdlintern.pl - A perl utility to display the different visited
    directories.

SYNOPSIS
       cdl var : will search in CDLOG any file/dir name containing var
       cdl <regexp> : will search in CDLOG any file/dir which matches
                    regular expression regexp.
       cdl -h : to print this help
       cdl -c : to clean the $CDLOG ( removing unused item )
       cdl -d abc : It is similar to cdl abc but it will search from
           current directory
       cdl -? : This will print last 10 entries.
       cdl -n? : This will print last n entries.

DESCRIPTION
    It is designed to be used from bash. The idea is that on every directory
    change by cd command, we save the directory into a log file. Any time,
    to go back to a previous visited directory, we can use cdl command with
    directory name by regular expression.

    To be used from bash, we have to define two function named cd and cdl.
    My functions are attached in this documentation. Log file name is given
    by a environment variable CDLOG. By default shell function cd sets the
    CDLOG to $HOME/tmp/cdsave/`hostname`cdlog.txt. If directory doesn't
    exist then it creates it.

    On execution when it prints "Enter directory Option/Command" . When we
    enter the number, it changes the directory to the directory. If we don't
    enter the number, it treats it as a shell command and tries to execute
    it. The usefulness of the this feature is that in shell command we can
    refer the corresponding directories by their number using $5. In the
    command we can use $n to replace the directory name. e.g command : diff
    $5 $6 will run the diff command with directory entry 5 and directory
    entry 6.

    Advantages over pushd/popd/dirs :

    * It saves the visited directoy in log file so it could remain save for
    days and months until you delete it. Also it remain valid for several
    invocation of shell.
    * Any shell operation ( e.g copying/moving files) between directories
    with deep nesting is much simpler.

CONFIGURATION
    Copy this script anywhere in the directory which is inside PATH. I
    prefer to put it in ~/bin directory.

    Configuring .bashrc: Here are the bash functions which need. To use it
    from .bashrc we need to declare the two functions.

function cd () 
{ 
	set +u
	CDLOG_File=~/tmp/cdsave/cdlog`hostname`.txt
	#echo "File is $CDLOG_File"
	if [ -z "$CDLOG"  ]; then
		export CDLOG=$CDLOG_File
		touch $CDLOG
		chmod 666 $CDLOG
	fi
	CDLOG_Dir=`dirname $CDLOG_File`
	#echo "Dir is $CDLOG_Dir"
	if [ ! -d  "$CDLOG_Dir" ]; then
		mkdir -p ~/tmp/cdsave
	fi
	if [ $#  -eq 0 ]
	then
		builtin cd $HOME
	else
		#echo "now I will cd to $HOME";
		builtin cd "$*"
	fi
	pwd >>$CDLOG
	unset CDLOG_File
	unset CDLOG_Dir
	#echo "Hello at End"
}
	
function cdl () 
{
	set +u
	if [ -z "$CDLOG" ]
	then
		cd "."
		#source ~/bin/mycd.sh "."
	fi
	if test -e ~/bin/cdlintern.pl 
	then
		#echo "Running ~/bin/cdlintern.pl";
		perl ~/bin/cdlintern.pl $*
	else
		#echo "Running cdlintern.pl in path ";
		#which cdlintern.pl
		perl -S cdlintern.pl $*
	fi
	if [ -f "$CDLOG.sh" ]
	then
		source "$CDLOG.sh" 
	else
		echo "$CDLOG.sh doesn't exist"
	fi
}
export BASH_VERSION

EXAMPLES
    [~] $ cd /tmp/
    [/tmp] $ cd /var
    [/var] $ cdl
    1 ----> /tmp <--- 1
    2 ----> /var <--- 2
    Enter directory Option/Command : 1
    cd /tmp
    CommandLine = cd /tmp ; CDORGCMD="cdl "; history -s cd /tmp
    [/tmp] $ cd /usr/bin
    [/usr/bin] $ cd /usr/local/bin
    [/usr/local/bin] $ cdl bin$
    1 ----> /usr/bin <--- 1
    2 ----> /usr/local/bin <--- 2
    Enter directory Option/Command : 1
    cd /usr/bin
    CommandLine = cd /usr/bin ; CDORGCMD="cdl bin$"; history -s cd /usr/bin
    [/usr/bin] $ cdl bin$
    1 ----> /usr/bin <--- 1
    2 ----> /usr/local/bin <--- 2
    Enter directory Option/Command : ln -s $1/customapp $2/myapp
    ln -s /usr/bin/customapp /usr/local/bin/myapp
    CommandLine = ln -s /usr/bin/customapp /usr/local/bin/myapp ;
    CDORGCMD="cdl bin$"; history -s ln -s /usr/bin/customapp
    /usr/local/bin/myapp
    [/usr/bin] $

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
    CDLOG contains the name of the log file where it saves the visited
    directories. The schell function cd set's it to default
    ~/tmp/cdsave/cdlog`hostname`.txt. You can set it to /tmp/cdlog.txt for
    simplicity.
